# Please note
The last commit will not compile, I changed the file structure and haven't updated includes. Also everything in `private_lib` is in the process of being replaced by classes (So the FTDI debugger can do fun debugging stuff, also to decrease amount of copy and pasted code [Just look at analog_io lol]).
